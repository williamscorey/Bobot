Our group consists of Corey Williams, Jacob Phelps, and James Richards. We are from Chester County High School and we are proud of our project. Jacob was the project manager, Corey was the hardware manager, and James was the coding manager. We had a difficult time with testing a lot of the code as we had to figure out how to wire certain hardware that wasnâ€™t originally built to work together. 

Corey- doing this project has made me realize that I like building and wiring up hardware.

Jacob- doing this project has made me realize that I need to learn more about coding.

James- I found that I liked working with friends and overall getting stuff done while also having fun.
